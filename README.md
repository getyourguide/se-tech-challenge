# Objective

## Key Points
 * We want to assess your skills as a generalist software engineer.
 * We are looking for people who are able to work on a variety of projects and technologies.
 * We are not explicitly looking for expertise in a specific technology or domain. An ideal candidate would be able to work with a variety of technologies.

## Task
We would like you to build a web application that allows users to search for activities.
The project is meant to be a simple application that you can build in a few hours.
We are not looking for a production-ready application, at the same time we will evaluate your choices, assumptions, and design decisions.

In this repository you will find a list of activities that you can use to build your application (please find the file `activities.json` in the `resources` folder).

We bootstrapped in advance 2 skeleton applications for the back end and the front end: you will find a skeleton SpringBoot backend application and a VueJS frontend application.
You can either use them as a starting point or you can start from scratch choosing the technologies you are most familiar with or you think most appropriate to fullfill the requirements.

# Requirements
 * The backend application is meant to expose an API (REST or GraphQL).
 * The client application should consume the API and implement a UI.
 * The client should display the list of activities to the user and allow the user to search for activities by title by providing an input field.
 * You need to decide if the filtering logic should be implemented on the client or on the server.
 * The API should be consumed on localhost on a port of your choice.

# How to submit your work
Please fork this repository and send us a link to your forked repository or a zip file containing your work.

:warning: **Make sure not to publish your work on a public repository.**

# Presentation
 * We will ask you to present your work. Please be prepared to present your work and explain your choices.
 * We will ask clarifying questions about your code and your design choices.
 * In addition to the presentation we might ask you to refactor the code, add addional features, or fix bugs:
please be prepared to share your screen during the interview and to code live with us.
